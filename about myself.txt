I am 29 years old. I was born in the Rivne region but lived in Ternopil for a long time. But because of the situation in my native country, I had to go abroad. And now I temporarily live in Croatia. I'm married. I have no children. 
My main interests are learning new things, gaining new knowledge, and reading. I also love to cook, especially desserts. In my free time, I go to the mountains, travel, and dive in the summer. Snorkeling was a new discovery for me in the summer. This is very interesting.
She graduated from the university in 2018, majoring in "medical affairs". Worked as a doctor for over 4 years. I gained skills in attention to detail, analysis, problem-solving, and customer service.
I once had to deal with a difficult case where a patient had unexplained symptoms that did not fit standard diagnoses. I conducted an in-depth analysis, consulted with colleagues, and studied additional sources of information. In the end, it was possible to establish a diagnosis and prescribe the correct treatment. This task taught me attentiveness, persistence, and finding non-standard solutions.
My goal in QA is to become skilled in ensuring product quality and creating reliable, user-friendly software. I want to improve my technical skills, learn more about testing processes, and grow in automation. I also aim to communicate effectively within a team to find and solve issues. Continuous learning and contributing to high-quality software are very important to me.
